## 2018.2.0 (08 Mar 2018)

[Release pushed by one week]

### Thanks

We appreciate everyone who contributed to this release (including
those who reported bugs or provided feedback)!

A special thanks goes out to the following external contributors who
contributed code in this release:

* [Andrea D'Amore](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/commits?author=anddam)
* [Tzu-ping Chung](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/commits?author=uranusjr)
* [Elliott Beach](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/commits?author=elliott-beach)

1. Support for [direnv](https://direnv.net/)
   ([#36](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/36))
1. Support for pipenv virtual environments; do note that using pipenv
   automatically drops all other interpreters from the list of
   possible interpreters as pipenv prefers to "own" your virtual
   environment
   ([#404](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/404))
1. Support for pyenv installs of Python
   ([#847](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/847))

1. Prompting to install a linter now allows for disabling that specific
   linter as well as linters globally

### Fixes

1. Work around a bug in Pylint when the default linter rules are
   enabled and running Python 2.7 which triggered `--py3k` checks
   to be activated, e.g. all `print` statements to be flagged as
   errors
   ([#722](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/722))
1. Better detection of when a virtual environment is selected, leading
   to the extension accurately leaving off `--user` when installing
   Pylint ([#808](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/808))
1. Better detection of a `pylintrc` is available to automatically disable our
   default Pylint checks

   folder so e.g. yapf detect their configuration files appropriately
   ([#730](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/730))
1. The banner to suggest someone installs Python now says `Download`
   instead of `Close` ([#844](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/844))
1. Formatting while typing now treats `.` and `@` as operators,
   preventing the incorrect insertion of whitespace
   ([#840](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/840))
1. Debugging from a virtual environment named `env` now works
   ([#691](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/691))
1. Disabling linting in a single folder of a mult-root workspace no
   longer disables it for all folders ([#862](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/862))
1. Fix the default debugger settings for Flask apps
   ([#573](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/573))
1. Format paths correctly when sending commands through WSL and git-bash;
   this does not lead to official support for either terminal
   ([#895](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/895))
1. Prevent run-away Jedi processes from consuming too much memory by
   automatically killing the process; reload VS Code to start the
   process again if desired
   ([#926](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/926),
    [#263](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/263))
1. Support multiple linters again
   ([#913](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/913))
1. Don't over-escape markup found in docstrings
   ([#911](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/911),
    [#716](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/716),
    [#627](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/627),
    [#692](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/692))
1. Fix when the `Problems` pane lists file paths prefixed with `git:`
   ([#916](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/916))
1. Fix inline documentation when an odd number of quotes exists
   ([#786](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/786))
1. Don't erroneously warn macOS users about using the system install
   of Python when a virtual environment is already selected
   ([#804](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/804))
1. Fix activating multiple linters without requiring a reload of
   VS Code
   ([#971](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/971))

   ([#674](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/674),
    [#607](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/607),
    [#99](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/99))
1. Removed the banner announcing the extension moving over to
   Microsoft ([#830](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/830))
1. Renamed the default debugger configurations ([#412](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/412))
