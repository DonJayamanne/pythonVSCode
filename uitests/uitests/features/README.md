# Tags
* @wip
    * Used only for debugging purposes.
    * When debugging in VSC, only features/scenarios with @wip tag will be executed.
* @skip
    * Used to skip a feature/scenario.
* @https://github.com/xxx/yyy.git
    * Can only be used at a feature level.
    * The conents of the above repo will be used as the contents of the workspace folder.
    * Note: assume the tag is `@https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pyvscSmokeTesting.git`
        * The above repo is cloned directly into the workspace.
    * If however the tag is `@https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pyvscSmokeTesting/tests`
        * Now, the contents of the workspace is the `tests` directory in the above repo.
    * This allows us to have a single repo with files/tests for more than just one feature/scenario.
    * Else we'd need to have multiple repos for each feature/scenario.
* @preserve.workspace
    * Ensures the previous workspace state is used for testing.
    * I.e. state setup in previous state is not reset (makes it easier to re-use state from preivous scenarios).
* @mac, @win, @linux
    * Used to ensure a particular feature/scenario runs only on mac, win or linux respectively.
* @python2, @python3, @python3.5, , @python3.6, , @python3.7
