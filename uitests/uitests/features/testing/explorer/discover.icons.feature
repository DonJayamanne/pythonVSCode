Feature: Test Explorer Discovering icons and stop discovery

    Scenario: When discovering tests, the nodes will have the progress icon and clicking stop will stop discovery (unitest)
        Given the workspace setting "python.testing.pyTestEnabled" is disabled
        And the workspace setting "python.testing.unittestEnabled" is enabled
        And the workspace setting "python.testing.nosetestsEnabled" is disabled
        When I reload VSC
        When I select the command "Python: Discover Tests"
        Then the test explorer icon will be visible
        When I select the command "View: Show Test"
        And I expand all of the test tree nodes
        Then there are 14 nodes in the tree
        # Now, add a delay for the discovery of the tests
        Given a file named "tests/test_discovery_delay" is created with the following contents
            """
            10
            """
        When I select the command "Python: Discover Tests"
        And I wait for 1 second
        Then all of the test tree nodes have a progress icon
        And the stop icon is visible in the toolbar
        When I stop discovering tests
        Then the stop icon is not visible in the toolbar

    Scenario: When discovering tests, the nodes will have the progress icon and clicking stop will stop discovery (pytest)
