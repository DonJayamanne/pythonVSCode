Feature: Test Explorer Running icons and stop running
    Scenario: When running tests, the nodes will have the progress icon and clicking stop will stop running (unitest)
        Given the workspace setting "python.testing.pyTestEnabled" is disabled
        And the workspace setting "python.testing.unittestEnabled" is enabled
        And the workspace setting "python.testing.nosetestsEnabled" is disabled
        When I reload VSC
        When I select the command "Python: Discover Tests"
        Then the test explorer icon will be visible
        When I select the command "View: Show Test"
        And I expand all of the test tree nodes
        And the file "tests/test_running_delay" has the following content
            """
            10
            """
        When I select the command "Python: Run All Tests"
        And I wait for 1 second
        Then all of the test tree nodes have a progress icon
        And the stop icon is visible in the toolbar
        When I stop running tests
        Then the stop icon is not visible in the toolbar
