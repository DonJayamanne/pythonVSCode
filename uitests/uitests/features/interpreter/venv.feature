Feature: Terminal (venv)
    Scenario: Interpreter display name contains the name of the venv folder
        When In Windows, I update the workspace setting "terminal.integrated.shell.windows" with the value "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"
        Given a venv with the name "venv 1" is created
        When In Mac, I update the workspace setting "python.pythonPath" with the value "venv 1/bin/python"
        When In Linux, I update the workspace setting "python.pythonPath" with the value "venv 1/bin/python"
        When In Windows, I update the workspace setting "python.pythonPath" with the value "venv 1/Scripts/python.exe"
        Then the python interpreter displayed in the the status bar contains the value "venv 1" in the display name

    @preserve.workspace
    Scenario: Venv is auto selected
        Given the workspace setting "python.pythonPath" does not exist
        And the user setting "python.pythonPath" does not exist
        Then the python interpreter displayed in the the status bar does not contain the value "venv 1" in the display name
        When I reload VSC
        Then the python interpreter displayed in the the status bar contains the value "venv 1" in the display name

    @preserve.workspace
    Scenario: Venv is not auto selected (if we already have a local interpreter selected)
        Given a generic Python Interpreter is selected
        And the user setting "python.pythonPath" does not exist
        Then the python interpreter displayed in the the status bar does not contain the value "venv 1" in the display name
        When I reload VSC
        Then the python interpreter displayed in the the status bar does not contain the value "venv 1" in the display name

    @preserve.workspace
    Scenario: Venv is not auto selected (if we have a global interpreter selected)
        Given the workspace setting "python.pythonPath" does not exist
        And the user setting "python.pythonPath" exists
        Then the python interpreter displayed in the the status bar does not contain the value "venv 1" in the display name
        When I reload VSC
        Then the python interpreter displayed in the the status bar does not contain the value "venv 1" in the display name

    @preserve.workspace
    Scenario: Environment is not activated in the Terminal
        When In Mac, I update the workspace setting "python.pythonPath" with the value "venv 1/bin/python"
        When In Linux, I update the workspace setting "python.pythonPath" with the value "venv 1/bin/python"
        When In Windows, I update the workspace setting "python.pythonPath" with the value "venv 1/Scripts/python.exe"
        Given the file "write_pyPath_in_log.py" is open
        And a file named "log.log" does not exist
        And the workspace setting "python.terminal.activateEnvironment" is disabled
        And a terminal is opened
        When I send the command "python write_pyPath_in_log.py" to the terminal
        Then a file named "log.log" is created
        And open the file "log.log"
        And the file "log.log" does not contain the value "env 1"
        And take a screenshot

        Then a file named "log.log" is created
        And open the file "log.log"
