Feature: Terminal (conda)
    Scenario: Interpreter display name contains the name of the environment and conda
        Given the user setting "python.pythonPath" does not exist
        And a conda environment is created with the name "helloworld"
        Then take a screenshot
        When I wait for 20 seconds
        Then take a screenshot
        # Wait for some time for the new conda environment to get discovered.
        When I reload VSC
        Then take a screenshot
        When I send the command "conda env list" to the terminal
        When I wait for 5 seconds
        Then take a screenshot
        When I wait for 20 seconds
        Then take a screenshot
        When I select the command "Python: Select Interpreter"
        When I wait for 3 seconds
        Then take a screenshot
        When I reload VSC
        And I wait for 30 seconds
        And I select the Python Interpreter containing the name "helloworld"
        Then take a screenshot
        Then the python interpreter displayed in the the status bar contains the value "conda" in the display name
        And the python interpreter displayed in the the status bar contains the value "helloworld" in the display name
        And the workspace setting "python.pythonPath" exists

#     When I reload VSC
#     Then the python interpreter displayed in the the status bar contains the value "pipenv" in the display name
#     And the python interpreter displayed in the the status bar contains the value "workspace folder" in the display name
#     Given the file "write_pyPath_in_log.py" is open
#     And a file named "log.log" does not exist
#     And the workspace setting "python.terminal.activateEnvironment" is disabled
#     And a terminal is opened
#     When I send the command "python run_in_terminal.py" to the terminal
