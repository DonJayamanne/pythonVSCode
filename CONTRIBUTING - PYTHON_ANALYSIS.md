## Contributing a pull request

### Prerequisites

1. .NET Core 2.1 SDK
   - [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/windows)
   - [Mac OS](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/macos)
   - [Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/linux/rhel)
2. C# Extension to VS Code (all platforms)
3. Python 2.7
4. Python 3.6

*Alternative:* [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) (Windows only) with .NET Core and C# Workloads. Community Edition is free and is fully functional.

### Setup

```shell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ptvs
cd Python/Product/VsCode/AnalysisVsc
dotnet build
```

Visual Studio 2017:
1. Open solution in Python/Product/VsCode
2. Build AnalysisVsc project
3. Binaries arrive in *Python/BuildOutput/VsCode/raw*
4. Delete contents of the *analysis* folder in the Python Extension folder
5. Copy *.dll, *.pdb, *.json fron *Python/BuildOutput/VsCode/raw* to *analysis*
6. In VS Code set setting *python.downloadCodeAnalysis* to *false*

### Debugging code in Python Extension to VS Code
Folow regular TypeScript debugging steps

### Debugging C# code in Python Analysis Engine
1. Launch another instance of VS Code
2. Open Python/Product/VsCode/AnalysisVsc folder
3. Python Analysis Engine code is in *Python/Product/VsCode/Analysis*
4. Run extension from VS Code
5. In the instance with C# code select Dotnet Attach launch task.
6. Attach to *dotnet* process running *Microsoft.PythonTools.VsCode.dll*

On Windows you can also attach from Visual Studio 2017.

### Validate your changes

1. Build C# code
2. Copy binaries to *analysis* folder
3. Use the `Launch Extension` launch option.

### Unit Tests
1. Run the Unit Tests via the `Launch Analysis Engine Tests`.
2. On Windows you can also open complete PTVS solution in Visual Studio and run its tests (or at least the Analysis section).
