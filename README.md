* Linting ([Prospector](https://pypi.io/project/prospector/), [Pylint](https://pypi.io/project/pylint/), [pycodestyle](https://pypi.io/project/pycodestyle/)/Pep8, [Flake8](https://pypi.io/project/flake8/), [pylama](https://github.com/klen/pylama), [pydocstyle](https://pypi.io/project/pydocstyle/) with config files and plugins)
* Intellisense (autocompletion with support for PEP-0484 and PEP 526)
* Auto indenting
* Code formatting ([autopep8](https://pypi.io/project/autopep8/), [yapf](https://pypi.io/project/yapf/), with config files)
* Code refactoring ([Rename](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Refactoring:-Rename), [Extract Variable](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Refactoring:-Extract-Variable), [Extract Method](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Refactoring:-Extract-Method), [Sort Imports](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Refactoring:-Sort-Imports))
* Viewing references, code navigation, view signature
* Excellent debugging support (remote debugging over SSH, mutliple threads, django, flask)
* Running and debugging Unit tests ([unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest), [pytest](https://pypi.io/project/pytest/), [nosetests](https://pypi.io/project/nose/), with config files)
* Execute file or code in a python terminal
* Local help file (offline documentation)
* Snippets

## Quick Start
* Install the extension
* optionally install `ctags` for Workspace Symbols, from [here](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/), or using `brew install ctags` on OSX.
* If Python is in the current path
  + You're ready to use it.
* To select a different Python Interpreter/Version (or use Virtual Environment), use the command [```Select Workspace Interpreter```](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Miscellaneous#select-an-interpreter))

## [Issues, Feature Requests and Contributions](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/issues)
* Contributions are always welcome. Fork it, modify it and create a pull request.
  + Details on contributing can be found [here](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Contribution) 
* Any and all feedback is appreciated and welcome.
  + Please feel free to [add suggestions here](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/issues/183)

## Feature Details
* IDE Features
  + Auto indenting
  + Code navigation (Go to, Find all references)
  + Code definition (Peek and hover definition, View Signature)
  + Rename refactoring
  + Sorting Import statements (use "Python: Sort Imports" command)
* [Intellisense and Autocomplete](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Autocomplete-Intellisense) with support for PEP-0484
  + Ability to include custom module paths (e.g. include paths for libraries like Google App Engine, etc.)
  + Use the `setting python.autoComplete.extraPaths = []`
  + For instance getting autocomplete/intellisense for Google App Engine, add the following to your settings file:
```json
"python.autoComplete.extraPaths": [
    "C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/google_appengine",
    "C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/google_appengine/lib" ]
```
* [Scientific tools (Jupyter/IPython)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python)
  + This functionality has been moved into a separate extension [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.jupyter)
* [Code formatting](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Formatting)
  + Auto formatting of code upon saving changes (default to 'Off')
  + Use either yapf or autopep8 for code formatting (defaults to autopep8)
* [Linting](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Linting)
  + It can be turned off (default is to be turned on and use pylint)
  + Multiple linters supported (along with support for configuration files for each linter)
  + Supported linters include pylint, pep8, flake8, pydocstyle, prospector
  + Paths to each of the linters can be optionally configured
  + Custom plugins such as pylint plugin for Django can be easily used by modifying the settings as follows:
```json
"python.linting.pylintArgs": ["--load-plugins", "pylint_django"]
``` 
* [Debugging](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Debugging)
  + Watch window
  + Evaluate Expressions
  + Step through code (Step in, Step out, Continue)
  + Add/remove break points
  + Local variables and arguments
  + Multiple Threads and Web Applications (such as Flask, Django, with template debugging)
  + Expanding values (viewing children, properties, etc)
  + Conditional break points
  + Remote debugging (over SSH)
  + Google App Engine
  + Debugging in the integrated or external terminal window
  + Debugging as sudo
* [Unit Testing](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/UnitTests)
  + Support for unittests, nosetests and pytest
  + Test results are displayed in the "Python" output window
  + Run failed tests, individual tests
  + Debugging unittests
* Snippets
* Miscellaneous
  + Running a file or selected text in python terminal
* Refactoring
  + [Rename Refactorings](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Refactoring:-Rename)
