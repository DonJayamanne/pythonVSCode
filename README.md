* Viewing references, code navigation, view signature
* Excellent debugging support (remote debugging over SSH, mutliple threads, django, flask)
* Running and debugging Unit tests ([unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest), [pytest](https://pypi.io/project/pytest/), [nose](https://pypi.io/project/nose/), with config files)
* Execute file or code in a python terminal
* Local help file (offline documentation)
* Snippets

## Quick Start
* Install the extension
* optionally install `ctags` for Workspace Symbols, from [here](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/), or using `brew install ctags` on macOS
* Select your Python interpreter
