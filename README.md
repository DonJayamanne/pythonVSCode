# Python extension for Visual Studio Code

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) with rich support for the [Python language](https://www.python.org/) (for all [actively supported versions](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches) of the language: >=3.7), including features such as IntelliSense (Pylance), linting, debugging, code navigation, code formatting, refactoring, variable explorer, test explorer, and more!

## Support for [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/)

The Python extension does offer [some support](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/wiki/Partial-mode) when running on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/) (which includes [github.dev](http://github.dev/)). This includes partial IntelliSense for open files in the editor.


## Installed extensions

The Python extension will automatically install the [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) extension to give you the best experience when working with Python files. However, Pylance is an optional dependency, meaning the Python extension will remain fully functional if it fails to be installed. You can also [uninstall](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_uninstall-an-extension) it at the expense of some features if you‚Äôre using a different language server.

Extensions installed through the marketplace are subject to the [Marketplace Terms of Use](https://cdn.vsassets.io/v/M146_20190123.39/_content/Microsoft-Visual-Studio-Marketplace-Terms-of-Use.pdf).
