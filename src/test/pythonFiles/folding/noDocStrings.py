# The server (i.e. the Python app) waits on a TCP port provided. Whenever anything connects to that port,
# it immediately sends the octet sequence 'PTVSDBG', followed by version number represented as int64,
# and then waits for the client to respond with the same exact byte sequence. After signatures are thereby
# exchanged and found to match, the client is expected to provide a string secret (in the usual debugger
# string format, None/ACII/Unicode prefix + length + data), which can be an empty string to designate the
# lack of a specified secret.
#
# If the secret does not match the one expected by the server, it responds with 'RJCT', and then closes
# the connection. Otherwise, the server responds with 'ACPT', and awaits a 4-octet command. The following
# commands are recognized:
#
# 'INFO'
#   Report information about the process. The server responds with the following information, in order:
#       - Process ID (int64)
#       - Executable name (string)
#       - User name (string)
#       - Implementation name (string)
#   and then immediately closes connection. Note, all string fields can be empty or null strings.
#
# 'ATCH'
#   Attach debugger to the process. If successful, the server responds with 'ACPT', followed by process ID
#   (int64), and then the Python language version that the server is running represented by three int64s -
#   major, minor, micro; From there on the socket is assumed to be using the normal PTVS debugging protocol.
#   If attaching was not successful (which can happen if some other debugger is already attached), the server
#   responds with 'RJCT' and closes the connection.
#
# 'REPL'
#   Attach REPL to the process. If successful, the server responds with 'ACPT', and from there on the socket
#   is assumed to be using the normal PTVS REPL protocol. If not successful (which can happen if there is
#   no debugger attached), the server responds with 'RJCT' and closes the connection.
