/*
* This was originally used to perform less on uris and turn them into base64 encoded so they can be loaded into 
* a webpack html. There's one caveat though. Less and webpack don't play well together. It runs the less at the root dir.
* This means in order to use this in a less file, you need to qualify the urls as if they come from the root dir. 
* Example:
* url("./foo.svg") 
* becomes
* url("./src/datascience-ui/history-react/images/foo.svg")
