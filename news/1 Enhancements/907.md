Add prelimnary support for remote debugging using the experimental debugger.
Attach to a Python program after having imported `ptvsd` and enabling the debugger to attach as follows:
```python
import ptvsd
ptvsd.enable_attach(('0.0.0.0', 5678))
```
Additional capabilities:
* `ptvsd.break_into_debugger()` to break into the attached debugger.
* `ptvsd.wait_for_attach(timeout)` to cause the program to wait untill a debugger attaches.
* `ptvsd.is_attached()` to determine whether a debugger is attached to the program.
