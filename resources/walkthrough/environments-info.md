## Python Environments

<img src="create-environment.svg" alt="Create Environment Dropdown">

Python virtual environments are considered a best practice in Python development. A virtual environment includes a Python interpreter and any packages you have installed into it, such as numpy or Flask.

After you create a virtual environment using the **Python: Create Environment** command, you can install packages into the environment.
For example, type `python -m pip install numpy` in an activated terminal to install `numpy` into the environment.
